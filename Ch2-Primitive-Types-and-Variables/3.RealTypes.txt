#Real Floating-Point Types

Real Types are the real numbers we know from math.
Rep by a floating-point and are float and double.

#Real Type Float
-32-bit
-AKA single precision real number.
-default value is 0.0f.
-f explicitly indicates that the number is of type float
(by default all real numbers are considered double)
-has accuracy up to 7 dp (the others are lost)
-range of values 
+-1.5 x 10^-45  to +-3.4 x 10^38.

##Special values of the Real Types
-special values that are not real numbers but mathematical
abstractions.
-Negative infinity(Single.NegativeInfinity)
Obtained when dividing -1.0f by 0.0f.

-Positive infinity(Single.PositiveInfinity)
Obtained when dividing 1.0f by 0.0f.

-Uncertainty(Single.NaN)
means that an invalid operation is performed by real numbers.
Obtained when e.g dividing 0.0f by 0.0f
as well as when calculating square root of a negative no.


#Real Type Double
-AKA double precision real number.
-64bit
-default value 0.0d
d isn't mandatory as all real numbers are double by default
- has a precision of 15-16 values
-ranges from +-5.0 x 10^-324 to +-1.7 x 10^308

smallest value is the constant Double.MinValue
= -1.79769e+308
and the largest value is Double.MaxValue
= 1.79769e+308

The closest to 0 is Double.Epsilon
=4.94066e-324

It can also take the special values
Double.PositiveInfinity, 
Double.NegativeInfinity
Double.NaN
