C# runs on CLR Environment.

##Microsoft .NET Framework
-----------------------------------------------
C# is not distributed as a stand alone product.
C# is part of .NET
.NET consists of an environment for the development
and execution of programs written in C# or other 
compatible languages.
It consist of 
	- .NET programming languages
	- env for execution of managed code ( CLR )
		Common Language Runtime
	- dev tools i.e csc compiler, turns C# programs 
	 into intermediate code(MSIL) that CLR can understand
	- standard libraries ADO. NET for access to DB
			     WCF conects apps to comm
				protocols i.e http.

--------------------------------------------------
FORMATING RULES
	-All class names start with a capital Letter
	-Variable names must begin with a lower-case
	-Method names must start with a capital letter

FILE NAMING
- Each class is defined in a seperate file, with a name
corresponding to the class name and .cs extension.

-----------------------------------------------
C#
.cs files are compiled by csc to executable code and 
as a result assemblies are created.
i.e same file, different extension (.exe or .dll)

.exe files cannot run on a computer that does not have
 the .NET Framework, you will receive an error.

Decompiling is the process which generates source code
from an existing executable binary file. We might to 
decompile in the following cases:
	- check how an algorithm is implemented.
	- how to use certain API
	- how a given library works
	- code recovery.
